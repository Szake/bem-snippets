Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues<br /> or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,<br /> which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure<br /> that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
